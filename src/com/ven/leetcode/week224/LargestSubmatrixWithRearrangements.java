/**
 * You are given a binary matrix matrix of size m x n, and you are allowed to
 * rearrange the columns of the matrix in any order.
 * 
 * Return the area of the largest submatrix within matrix where every element of
 * the submatrix is 1 after reordering the columns optimally.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[1,0,1]] Output: 4 Explanation: You can
 * rearrange the columns as shown above. The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold,
 * has an area of 4. Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [[1,0,1,0,1]] Output: 3 Explanation: You can rearrange the
 * columns as shown above. The largest submatrix of 1s, in bold, has an area of
 * 3. Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1]] Output: 2 Explanation: Notice that you must
 * rearrange entire columns, and there is no way to make a submatrix of 1s
 * larger than an area of 2. Example 4:
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [[0,0],[0,0]] Output: 0 Explanation: As there are no 1s, no
 * submatrix of 1s can be formed and the area is 0.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * m == matrix.length n == matrix[i].length 1 <= m * n <= 105 matrix[i][j] is 0
 * or 1.
